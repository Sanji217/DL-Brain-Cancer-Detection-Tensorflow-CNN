#Machine Learning Project : Predicting Brain Cancer Based on MRI Image
This project implement a deep learning model using tensorflow and convolutional neural network.It was implemented in Google Colab notebook.
#To open and run the notebook
1.Open the notebook in Google Colab
  -Click on the link [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m_y60DHDJ_0ylpPoqlQjX6ZiNlld00Qk?usp=sharing]
2.After opening the notebook, follow this steps:
 - Data loading
 - Model training and evaluation
 - Visualizations and results
3. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. The data used in this project can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
5. In this project, the performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy.
